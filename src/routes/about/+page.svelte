					"In this course we will familiarize ourselves with the fundamental algorithms and data
					structures that are used in todayâ€™s interactive graphics systems. The material we cover
					are the foundations of scientific visualization, virtual reality, computer games and film
					animation. We will start with topics such as pixel art, computational geometry, shape
					representation, transformation and animation, and move to more complex topics such as
					Image processing and filtering, ray tracing, and human visual perception. We will take
					time to see how modern game engines such as Unity and Unreal create high fidelity virtual
					environments. The course will include practical experience of graphical software
					environments such as WebGL and GLSL shading language."
